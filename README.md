Project Overview
In this project, I learned how to:

Use Node.js to create APIs.
Test APIs using Postman.
Work with MongoDB as a database.
Implement error handling using try-catch in APIs.
Use express-async-errors for efficient error handling, improving productivity and making the code cleaner and faster.(alternertive for try catch)
