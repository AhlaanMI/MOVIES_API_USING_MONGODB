Project Overview
In this project, I learned how to:

1.Use Node.js to create APIs.
2.Test APIs using Postman.
3.Work with MongoDB as a database.
4.Implement error handling using try-catch in APIs.
5.Use express-async-errors for efficient error handling, improving productivity and making the code cleaner and faster.(alternertive for try catch)
